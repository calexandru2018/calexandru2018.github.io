						The following project, is my web portfolio. Since I had finished a course on udemy about VueJS, I decided that it was about time that I put that knowledge to good use.
						This is the time first that I use VueJs on a large scale and it is also the first time that I really use a css pre-compiler (I used in a previous project, but only to minify, uglify and create chunks).
						I learned how to use SASS/SCSS (which I always wanted to do), and really got into it quickly.
						I used the Vue CLI 3 tool to quickly start working with a project, so that I can avoid the overhead of setting up a project from scratch,
						it is really much more effective to start with a boilerplate code.
						<u>This project was developed during during 2019, no business logic was implemented, apart from the PHP Mailer function.</u>

						This was another project that I developed for a customer in Portugal. Their main business is a food-truck,
						which they travel throughout Portugal selling their waffles and creps. 
						They wanted a webpage that could somehow make their on-line presence stronger. 
						The main goals was to somehow let customer know about the previous, actual and future locations, so that they could easily find them.
						I came up with the idea of a calendar, which they could insert the from-to dates and also the exact coordenates (longitute and latitude),
						enabling this way the end-user to click on the event and get a direct route suggestion to their exact location (Google Maps API). 
						I also managed to work a bit with the Instagram API, though it proved to be difficult since the token expire often. 
						To resolve this, I create a special button/function that allows the customer to generate a new token whenever the old one expires. 
						Most of the code is done in ES6 (arrow functions and fetch API), I used Babel in conjuction with Webpack to transpile code to older js.
						<u>This project was developed during late 2018 and begining of 2019, has both front and back-end. Front-end was developed only as a mobile version.</u>

						This was a projec that I developped for a customer, that wanted to be able to post real-estate for buy, rent and sale.
						I had to conduct multiple interviews with the customer so that I could gather all the necessary requirments for the project.
						Primarly the customer wanted also a back-end so that it could insert all information independentrly, for this to be accomplished,
						i designed the database in such way that it could accomodate multiple languages. The customer also expressed the need of a "create account" 
						functionality for the end-users, I advised that that we could perhaprs prioritize other areas instead, since the end-users could easily contact
						the customer. The customer is located in Portugal. <u>This project was developed in 2018 during a couple of months, has both front and back-end which is rather complex.</u>

						This was a hobby project that I developed, during the time I played football for a  football team. 
						Not everybody in our team had a facebook account to join a facebook group and to let the rest of the team team if they were attending the training session or not.
						I came up with the idea of making a simple webpage so that every member of our team could have a way to mark their attendance, 
						this in turn helped us (trainers) to 
						better plan our training sessions.
						<u>This project was developed in 2014, has both front and back-end.</u>
