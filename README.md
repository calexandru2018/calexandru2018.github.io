## Introduction: 
Since I have finished a udemy course on **VueJS**, I thought that it would be a good time to put all new gathered knowledge into practice. The code does not connect to a backend since I made it as a static webpage, where I will personally be adding new projects.

## Programming languages and technologies:

### Description
As I previously stated, the whole webpage was built with **VueJS**, more specifically with the **Vue CLi 3** tool, which is a really usefull to quickly start developping a project, specially since one can save custom "builds". Apart from applying my newly acquired knowledge, I actually managed to teached myself on how to use **SCSS**. I have never learnt how to do it but have always had a desire, and since the pre-processor already was installed by the cli tool, the only thing that I needed to do so that I could use **SCSS** was to add `lang="scss" ` to the style within a component or a view. I  started first by reading a couple of articles about it and gradually made changes to my code, so I could get more used to it and it would become more natural to me.

### Tech applied:
* VueJS  
* SCSS
* Git
